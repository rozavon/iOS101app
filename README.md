**Intro App** is an app that introduces who I am, where I go to school, and what I aspire to be. It also contains a feature that will randomly change the background color at the press of a button. Pretty cool, right?

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Bereal
   - hidden feed until you post a BeReal yourself
   - groups that were recently added to have BeReals separate from your main feed
   - being able to choose the frequency of BeReals inside groups
2. Duolingo
   - leaderboard and league rankings to keep you engaged
   - animations during lessons
   - report feedback feature on every question of each lesson
   - vibrant and intuitive UI
3. Snapchat
   - disappearing photos, videos, and messages
   - memories to be able to store photos and videos
   - "1 yr ago today" memory feature
  
My App Idea:
 I would like to make an app that makes it easy for people to store and organize quotes that they would like to remember. Right now, a lot of my friends keep a list of funny quotes that their friends have said in their notes app, but I think it would be cool if there was a specific app for this. Some features could be categorization, for example, to distinguish between funny things that your friends have said and quotes from philosophers or thought leaders that you would like to revisit to keep a certain perspective on life. Another feature would be an intuitive add function, to be able to quickly add a quote either by typing or speaking. You could also save the authors of quotes so that if they make another quote it will be faster to attribute the quote to them when you are adding. Another feature I really think would be cool would be memory quotes like Snapchat so you can see what quotes were made on a certain day 1 year or more ago. Maybe in the future, it could also be a sort of social app where you can share quotes to a feed where people you are friends with/follow can see them.
 
## Notes

The main challenge I faced while building this app was distinguishing between connection types. At first my button was not working because the connection type was an outlet instead of an action.
